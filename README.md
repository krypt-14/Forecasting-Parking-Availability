### Authors

This project is based on my final year group thesis from University of Sydney, where my group have presented on the theme of Smart City and how different sustainable method such as parking are an efficient way to manage and control traffic as well as control the number of vehicle can take in certain areas. 

For the purposes of the topic, I am only demonstrating on how the model is preprocess and develop to provide future forecasting for parking availability.
